# Project 0

This is CS50's project 0 by Mikkel Faartoft Jensen. The project is about me and it therefor contains some facts.

My project excists of 4 different html pages; index.html, about.html, city.html and finally interests.html. Each page has the same "<a>" tags so that you can navigate to every page from whichever page you are viewing. Furthermore the project make use of a single stylesheet, where i've used sass and simply compiled it to css.  

In index.html i've used 2 different Bootstrap components, a carousel and a card. I've used the Bootstrap grid model to define the size of my Bootstrap cards, where I make use of 3 columns for layout purposes.
 
In about.html I have created an unordered list that explains some quick facts about me.

City.html contains of a table showing the top 5 biggest cities of Denmark.

interests.html simply just describes some of my interests, here i decided to create the cards myself.

Throughout the whole project i've made use of id and classes.
